description: Microsoft 365 Message Trace follows email messages as they travel through
  your Exchange Online organization. You can determine if a message was received,
  rejected, deferred, or delivered by the service. It also shows what actions were
  taken on the message before it reached its final status. You can use the information
  from message trace to efficiently answer user questions about what happened to messages,
  troubleshoot mail flow issues, and validate policy changes.
