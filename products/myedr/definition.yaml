description: The solution implements agent-based protection using multiple security
  techniques, such as static and behavioral analysis and attack surface reduction.
  The solution implements all its prevention, detection, and response functionality
  using a single agent installed on the endpoint. The solution can automatically invoke
  a native malware response action, such as deleting or quarantining files, blocking
  or killing processes, and isolating compromised endpoints. The solution provides
  a severity rating, a process tree, and a mapping of events and alerts to MITRE ATT&CK
  tactics, techniques and procedures to aid root cause analysis and remediation. The
  solution provides support for new versions of major operating systems, including
  Windows, macOS and Linux, within 90 days of the OS release. The solution provides
  a cloud-based, SaaS-style, multitenant security analytics and management infrastructure
  that is required to be maintained by the EPP vendor. The solution stores endpoint
  telemetry and detection events in its management infrastructure for at least 30
  days, with the ability to extend or forward to other long-term storage. The solution
  natively integrates with vendor-owned or third-party security controls, such as
  identity protection, email security, security service edge and workload protection.
